#PDF-To-PPT Convertor

Introduction

This repository contains the source code for a Python and Java-based PDF-to-PPT converter application that is specifically designed to convert complex research papers into a clear, presentable PowerPoint format.

Purpose

The purpose of this application is to aid academics and professionals in making their research more accessible and understandable. By automating the conversion process, it allows users to focus on their research instead of spending time creating presentations.

How It Works

The application utilizes Python and Java to extract text, images, and tables from PDFs. It leverages the power of text summarization and various data extraction libraries to accurately extract and present the data from the PDFs into PowerPoint presentations. In addition, it is designed to handle edge cases such as large PDF files, corrupted PDFs, PDFs with unusual formatting, and empty PDFs gracefully.

Key Features

Text Summarization: Condense the verbose language often used in research papers into simple, concise summaries.
Image and Table Processing: Properly extract and integrate images and tables from the PDF into the generated PPT.
Edge Case Handling: Adequate handling of large files, corrupted files, unusual formatting, and empty files.
User-Friendly GUI: A simple and intuitive user interface that anyone can navigate with ease.
